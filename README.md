# Data Analysis of IQTP Marketing Data

## Summary

IQTalent Partners is a top 30 recruitment search firm and growing. There is no current analytics positions within the company, so I teamed with the marketing department to analyze the data we have captured and find useful information to help with making business decisions.

## Motivation

By providing support to marketing, I will be able to bring the first in-house data analysis to the company.
My goal would be able to show the business value in creating a data-intensive team that would help capture and analyze data to make decisions.

##  Analysis

I will be doing a full analysis of all of our contacts in the specific areas: Industry, annual revenue, company size and location.

I will also analyze data of companies that are using IQTP recruiting services.
 
## Product

The final product will be a full analysis of the marketing data we have captured. This will be displayed in a PowerBI dashboard for visualization and a slideshow listed here:

## Data Sources

Hubspot is the CRM through which the data is held. I have been made a special account by the marketing department so that I can access the marketing data specific to IQTalent Partners. I am unable to share the data all the data.
